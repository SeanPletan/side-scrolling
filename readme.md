# Side Scrolling Three.js Boilerplate

## Description
This is a boilerplate program where, when the user scrolls down, the camera rotates and moves in a circular motion. view height is set to 400vh, so the user has adequate specificity in where the page is scrolled to. What isn't implemented are dead-zones (where the developer may want to put items of interest).
